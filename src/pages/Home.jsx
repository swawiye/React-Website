        <h4>The beautiful journey of today can only begin when we learn to let go of yesterday (Steve Maraboli)</h4>
        <p>
        This statement bears weight in each of our own lives. Our past is significant not only to the present 
        but also to the future. However, it does not define us. We ourselves are a collection of memories we 
        have made, experiences we have had and predicaments that we have encountered. As a result, our behaviour 
        reflects these three aspects(memories, experiences & predicaments). I believe that self-reflection is 
        important because it takes into account our memories, experiences and challenges. Reflection takes you 
        into a deep dive of seeing what lies in you below the surface. It enables you to peel away layers and 
        uncover truths that you have truly known all along. Our subconcious minds are awakened and strengthened 
        resulting in unlocking of the true power that you hold within. I invite you to travel on this journey 
        with me as I dive deep to look within myself. Gaze into the mirror with me, as I reflect. I hope that 
        this experience can empower you to stop shying away from self-introspection and use self-reflection as 
        a tool to empower your being.
